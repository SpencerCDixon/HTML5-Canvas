## HTML5 Canvas Information

If you adjust the size of a canvas with CSS the drawing surface will remain the
default size of 300 x 150.  It will end up doing some weird things that you
wouldn't expect.

**TIP**: Use the profiler to help debug:

```javascript
console.profile("Start profiling here");

code 

console.profileEnd();
```
